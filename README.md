# mysql-database-chatterbox

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor, while pairing with [@abouzol-gna](https://github.com/abouzol-gna). We replaced storage in a file with storage in a MySQL database for the previously-built [chatterbox chat client](https://github.com/madbernard/ajax-parse-chat-chatterbox-client).
